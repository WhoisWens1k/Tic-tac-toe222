# How to Save the Avatar Images

## Problem
The avatar images are not displaying correctly because they can't be found at the expected paths:
- `/avatars/avatar1.png`
- `/avatars/avatar2.png`
- `/avatars/avatar3.png`

## Solution

### Step 1: Create the avatars folder
Make sure you have an `avatars` folder inside the `public` directory:

```
public/
  ├── avatars/
  ├── index.html
  └── manifest.json
```

### Step 2: Save the images
Save the three character images with these exact names:

1. First image (samurai with moon background): `avatar1.png`
2. Second image (character with fox mask): `avatar2.png`
3. Third image (profile view character): `avatar3.png`

### Step 3: Save to the correct location
Place these files in the `public/avatars` folder.

### Detailed Instructions for Windows

1. Right-click on each image and select "Save image as..."
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Go to the `public` folder
4. Go to the `avatars` folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
5. Save the image with the correct name (avatar1.png, avatar2.png, or avatar3.png)

### Alternative: Use the File Explorer

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to your project folder: `C:\Users\Wens1\OneDrive\Desktop\tic tac toe\public`
3. Create a folder named `avatars` if it doesn't exist
4. Copy your three images into this folder
5. Rename them to `avatar1.png`, `avatar2.png`, and `avatar3.png`

### After Saving the Images

Once you've saved the images in the correct location, refresh your browser or restart the development server with `npm start` to see the changes.

## Troubleshooting

If the images still don't appear:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for 404 errors
2. Verify the image paths are exactly `/avatars/avatar1.png`, `/avatars/avatar2.png`, and `/avatars/avatar3.png`
3. Make sure the images are in the correct format (PNG)
4. Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

The app now has fallback text that will display if the images can't be loaded, but it's better to fix the image paths for the best experience.
